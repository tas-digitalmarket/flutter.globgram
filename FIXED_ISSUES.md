# Globgram P2P Chat Application - Fixed Issues

## Fixed Issues

1. **Flutter Sound Plugin Issues**
   - The Flutter Sound plugin was causing 404 errors for web assets
   - No actual code was using Flutter Sound, but it was still trying to load the JS files
   - Removed the dependency and cleaned the project to prevent loading errors

2. **Localization Issues**
   - The app was trying to load `en-US.json` when it should be using `en.json`
   - Added `useOnlyLangCode: true` to the EasyLocalization configuration
   - This ensures only base language codes are used (en, fa, es) instead of locale variants

3. **P2P Messaging Issues**
   - Messages were being sent back to the sender (echoing in the same browser tab)
   - Added explicit checks in `BroadcastSignalingService._handleChatMessage()` to ignore messages from the same peer
   - Added additional logging to help with debugging

## Testing

1. **Clean Installation**
   - Performed `flutter clean` to remove build artifacts
   - Ran `flutter pub get` to get clean dependencies

2. **P2P Communication Test**
   - Open two browser tabs with the application
   - Create/join the same room in both tabs
   - Send messages between tabs
   - Verify messages only appear in the intended recipient's tab

3. **Localization Test**
   - Verify the app properly loads translations
   - Test switching between languages (en, fa, es)
   - Verify RTL support with Farsi (fa) language

## Future Improvements

1. **Sound Message Handling**
   - If voice messages are needed, consider replacing Flutter Sound with a more web-compatible solution
   - Consider using the Web Audio API directly for web platforms

2. **Robust P2P Fallback**
   - Implement STUN/TURN server fallbacks for challenging network environments
   - Add connection quality indicators

3. **Offline Support Enhancement**
   - Implement a more robust message queue for offline scenarios
   - Add sync status indicators

## Maintenance Notes

- When updating dependencies, be cautious with Flutter Sound or other plugins that might have web compatibility issues
- The P2P system uses both WebRTC and BroadcastChannel for maximum compatibility
- Always test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for maximum compatibility
